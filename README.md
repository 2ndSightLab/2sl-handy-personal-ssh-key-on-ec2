Add your own SSH key to a Linux EC2 instance

Createa new ssh key on your system
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@your_domain.com"

Follow the prompts:
```
Generating public/private ed25519 key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/path/.ssh/id_ed25519): [file name]  
Enter passphrase for "[file name]" (empty for no passphrase): 
Enter same passphrase again: 
Your identification has been saved in hacker.key
Your public key has been saved in hacker.key.pub
The key fingerprint is:
SHA256:[key id] [email]
The key's randomart image is:
[IMAGE]
```
```
ls -al
```
You'll see:

```
[filename] (your file)
[filename].pub (your public key)
```

Backup your keys to a secure location.

Change the permissions on the private key.

```
chmod 400 [filename]
```

Add the public key to the EC2 instance.

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/replacing-key-pair.html

Using a text editor of your choice, open the .ssh/authorized_keys file on the instance. Paste the public key information from your new key pair underneath the existing public key information. Save the file.

i.e. copy [filename].pub above to .ssh/authorized_keys/[filename].pub on your EC2 instance.

You can also add it programmatically when creating an AMI.

You can leave the existing key as a backup or remove it if you are confident you will not lose your own key - AWS can't help you if you do.
                                    
Test connecting to your instance using your new key.

Remember that if you change the underlying instance for a key you have created you will need to remove it from .ssh/known_hosts. I usually just delete that whole directory when usign the same key to connnect to a different instance. I've also written about the risks surrounding that error message here:

https://medium.com/cloud-security/warning-remote-host-identification-has-changed-30e0f4164160

Benefits and risks:
* Use the same key across a number of hosts. This is also a risk as an attacker only has to steal one key to get access to all.
* Requires a passphrase to access the host (though if it's easy to guess not that much help).
* Can use automation to periodically rotate the SSH keys (not saying it's easy and need to look into that a bit more - can AWS Secrets Manager do that?)
* If you lose the private key you created, AWS can't help you.
